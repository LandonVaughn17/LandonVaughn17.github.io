				<p>James Cook is the number 3 running back in the class of 2018. He selected University of Georgia
				over Louisville, Florida State and Florida. He is the younger brother of former Florida State and Minnesota Vikings Dalvin Cook.
				Zamir White is a bigger more physical running back than James Cook. Zamir White is a slasher who averaged 10 yeards
				a carry in High School. No one is Georgia history has rushed for more yards than Zamir White.Having lost Sony Michel and Nick Chubb, these two running backs will bring the program
				two very good backs to replace Sony and Nick. Justin Fields is by far the biggest commit of the 2018 class. He is fast and has a big arm. He style of play is
				very similar to that of Cam Newton of the Carolina Panthers. The is the first time the number 1 ranked player in the country has commited to the University of 
				Georgia. Adam Anderson Is a thin edge rushing linebacker that will bring many problems to any quarterback UGA faces. He sacked Justin Fields twice when they faced each
				other at the beginning of the season.
